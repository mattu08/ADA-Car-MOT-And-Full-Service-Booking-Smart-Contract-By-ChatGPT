# ADA-Car-MOT-And-Full-Service-Booking-Smart-Contract-By-ChatGPT
This is a ADA Plutus Car MOT and Full Service Booking Smart Contract written from a conversation with OpenAI's ChatGPT. There maybe some mistakes like missing the 180 ADA for both, but not a bad example.

## Question: Could you create an ADA Smart contract that you book a car in for a full service and MOT, .e.g. Service 170 ADA and MOT 50 ADA and both for 180 ADA?

Yes, I can provide an example of a smart contract that allows users to book a car for a full service and MOT (Ministry of Transport) test using the ADA cryptocurrency. Here's an example:

```haskell
-- Define a car service and MOT booking smart contract.

smart contract CarBooking
  record Booking =
    { serviceName: String;
      servicePrice: Ada; }

  record CarBooking =
    { service: Booking;
      mot: Booking; }

  -- Define the available service and MOT options.
  entrypoint getServiceOptions(): Booking is
    return {serviceName: "Full Service", servicePrice: 170};
  end getServiceOptions;

  entrypoint getMOTOptions(): Booking is
    return {serviceName: "MOT", servicePrice: 50};
  end getMOTOptions;

  -- Define a function to book a car for both service and MOT.
  entrypoint bookCarServiceAndMOT(): Bool is
    let serviceOption = getServiceOptions();
    let motOption = getMOTOptions();
    let bookingPrice = serviceOption.servicePrice + motOption.servicePrice;
    require(tx.value >= bookingPrice, "Insufficient funds to book the service and MOT.");
    return True;
  end bookCarServiceAndMOT;
end CarBooking;
```

This smart contract defines a ***'Booking'*** record type that represents a car service or MOT booking with a name and price. It also defines a ***'CarBooking'*** record type that combines a service booking and an MOT booking.

The ***'getServiceOptions()'*** and ***'getMOTOptions()'*** functions return the available service and MOT options.

The ***'bookCarServiceAndMOT()'*** function allows users to book a car for both service and MOT by calculating the booking price based on the selected service and MOT options. The function then checks that the user has sent enough ADA to cover the booking price and returns ***'True'*** if the booking is successful.

Note that this is just a simple example, and a real-world car booking smart contract would likely need additional functionality to handle car details, booking dates, cancellations, and other features. Additionally, this smart contract does not handle any security concerns or validation, which would need to be added in a real-world application.
